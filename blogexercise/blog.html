        <p class="quotes">You have to make these big decisions. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Don't fight it, use what happens.</p>

        <p>Even the worst thing we can do here is good. See there, told you that would be easy. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow.</p>

        <p>Learn when to stop. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Work that paint. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead.</p>

        <p class="quotes">For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. That's crazy. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Be careful. You can always add more - but you can't take it away. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.</p>

        <p>Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. If what you're doing doesn't make you happy - you're doing the wrong thing. It's so important to do something every day that will make you happy. Use your imagination, let it go.</p>

        <p>We'll make some happy little bushes here. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. Let your imagination be your guide.</p>
